Internship Task 2 — Social media sentiment Analysis(twitter) by Ravi Kumar
In this project, instead of manually downloading the dataset, I used the Kaggle API to securely and efficiently fetch the large Twitter sentiment dataset (≈1.6M tweets).

This approach ensures:
>> Reproducibility across environments
>> Time efficiency (no manual uploads)
>> Professional automation for large-scale data handling


“To handle the large dataset (1.6 million tweets), I integrated the Kaggle API directly in my Colab notebook. This allowed me to automatically authenticate using my Kaggle API key, download the dataset programmatically, and proceed to preprocessing and NLP sentiment analysis without manual data handling. This demonstrates workflow automation and reproducibility, which are best practices in professional data analytics projects. We can also visualize this data by "Power BI" dashboard, as created in tesk 1.”
